# Book-Recommendation-System
A Book recommendation System using:
  1. K Nearest Neighbours Algorithm
  2. Using Correlation
  3. Based on Popularity(No of Ratings and Ratings-sum)
  
  
Dataset used: Book-Crossings

Book-Crossings is a book ratings dataset compiled by Cai-Nicolas Ziegler based on data from bookcrossing.com. It contains 1.1 million ratings of 270,000 books by 90,000 users. The ratings are on a scale from 1 to 10, and implicit ratings are also included.
The Book-Crossings dataset is one of the least dense datasets, and the least dense dataset that has explicit ratings.

The Project includes:
  1. Importing Libraries and dataset
  2. Exploratory  data Analysis
  3. Data Visualization
  4. Simple Popularity based Recommendation System
  5. Recommending Similar Books using Correlation
  6. Collaborative Filtering Using KNN

Implementation includes Item Based Collaborative Filtering.For Item-based CF, we say that two items are similar when they received similar ratings from a same user.Thus we predicted top 5 Books similar to a random chosen Book based on user Ratings.
